# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer: 

  Researched answer:



1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: software or tool that helps developers to manage their code. Github is the online place where the code is stored.

  Researched answer: Git is a version control system and is local. It stores and tracks your code history. Github is a cloud-based platform,owned by Microsoft, that allows multiple developers to collaborate on code and see edits in real time. It can also be used as a networking site as you can set your repos to be public. It's like a portfolio of your code work that you can share with anyone, especially employers.



2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: conditional statements returning true or false. Uses equal signs 
  and <,>

  Researched answer: logical, relational, and equality operators



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: Index gives the location of a character starting at 0. Values are the info inside the function

  Researched answer: Index shows the position of the element within a string. Values are used with variables. Values can be boolean, string, numbers, or arrays. If the fridge is the variable, the food inside are the values...thought of that myself...hope it makes sense, haha.



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: when you want to repeat something over and over until you tell it to stop

  Researched answer: The process of executing a block of code repeatedly until the specific condition you set is met, then it stops.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Two developers working on the same code together. One will be the navigator and the other the driver. The driver types and the navigator instructs the driver what to do.

  Researched answer: two developers collaborating on the same code. The driver writes the code while the navigator looks over each line of code looking to spot erors. The two switch roles on a regular basis. This allows mistakes to be caught early and results in less bugs. It also makes it easier when a coworker goes on vacation or switches to a new team or leaves the company to continue working on the code in their absence. Pair programming also fosters more creativity and possible solutions as two minds are better than one.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: built-in methods in JS. They use functions as the argument, or return a different function as an output. Thye must include at least 1 argument but can have more if neccessary.

2. Jest: A JS testing framework created by Facebook that is designed to makle sure any JS codebase is correct. It will help immensly in job hunts becasue it helps everyone by helping to make your code cleaner, helps save time debugging because you have less bugs, helps communicate to fellow developers whats going on in your code. It can also create a safe place to refactor your code. Win-win for all!.....Actually really interested to learn about this!!!

3. Objects: They are the where the data meets the behavior. They are collections of key:value pairs and can also contain functions

4. Method: when an object contains a function we call it a method and it refers to the object.

5. Classes: type of function containing data and behavior. You can customize them they are reusable.
